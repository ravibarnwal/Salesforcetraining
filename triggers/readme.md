# Triggers

Apex can be invoked by using triggers. Apex triggers enable you to perform custom actions before or after changes to Salesforce records, such as insertions, updates, or deletions.
A trigger is Apex code that executes before or after the following types of operations:
- insert
- update
- delete
- merge
- upsert
- undelete


For example, you can have a trigger run before an object's records are inserted into the database, after records have been deleted, or even after a record is restored from the Recycle Bin.

For example, you can have a trigger run before an object's records are inserted into the database, after records have been deleted, or even after a record is restored from the Recycle Bin.

You can define triggers for top-level standard objects that support triggers, such as a Contact or an Account, some standard child objects, such as a CaseComment, and custom objects. To define a trigger, from the object management settings for the object whose triggers you want to access, go to Triggers.

There are two types of triggers:
- *Before triggers* are used to update or validate record values before theyâ€™re saved to the database.
- *After triggers* are used to access field values that are set by the system (such as a record's Id or LastModifiedDate field), and to affect changes in other records, such as logging into an audit table or firing asynchronous events with a queue. The records that fire the after trigger are read-only.
